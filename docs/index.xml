      <description>Analysis of Public Policy: Perspectives and Methods focuses on empirical policy evaluation. The course introduces a political scientist view and a series of modern empirical methods into public policy analyses. Students will learn not only the fundamental analytic theories for public policy evaluation but also tools such as case study, survey, experiments, and big-data analysis, that can be used to analyze different types of policies. In every topic, we will include real-life cases to illustrate how the theories and method can be applied.</description>

      <description>Policies are everywhere in the modern society. They serve as the tie between the rulers and ruled and the means to steer collective actions for the given goals. In this sense, the ability to understand where policy comes from and how it runs and ends has become a crucial quality of the potential successors and leaders. Understanding Public Policies: Interdisciplinary Perspectives and Case Illustrations is the place you cultivate this quality.</description>
